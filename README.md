In this assignment, you will recreate the classic Crossy Road game, using the Unreal 4 Engine, assets
created using a Voxel editor such as Magica Voxel, and code written either in C++ (written to interface 
with Blueprints and the Unreal framework), or with Blueprints, or both. 

Your object is to...  Create all characters and objects using Magica Voxel, and import them into 
Unreal Engine, create the Blueprint code to duplicate the Crossy Road game (moving the chicken, 
having vehicles (cars, trucks, and trains go back and forth), have logs go back and forth on the river, 
and have the chicken live as long as possible.
